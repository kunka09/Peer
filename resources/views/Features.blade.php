      <p>League of Legends: Wild Rift is headed to its first Regional Closed Beta, starting September 16!

In the first Regional Closed Beta, we’re coming to select players in the Philippines, Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.

We’ll be rolling out to each region over time and adding waves of players throughout the Closed Beta, so keep an eye on your local Wild Rift social media pages to get the latest updates!

What’s the schedule?
September 16: Indonesia (testing with a very small number of invites)
September 18: Indonesia, Philippines, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand
Early October: Closed Beta pauses for a few days, and accounts are fully reset

(All other regions will be coming later.)

The Regional Closed Beta will primarily be on Android, 
but players can head over to the Wild Rift website to sign up for a chance to enter a small test on iOS alongside the Closed Beta. If you’re selected, you’ll get an email with further instructions.</p>
